determination of upper-atmosphere air density profile from satelliteobservations .the theory previously developed for the changes in the perigee distanceand semi-major axis of a satellite orbit due to air drag is extended toenable the air-density profile/i.e.its relative variation with height/tobe derived from the motion of the orbit's perigee . the solution isfirst obtained in terms of the change in perigee distance and then interms of the change in the radius of the earth at the sub-perigee pointthe scale height in the 180 and 220 km altitude regions .

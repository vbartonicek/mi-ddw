temperature profiles inafinite solid with moving boundary .a numerical solution is presented to the transient heat conductionequation for a cylinder of finite thickness with one moving boundary .the implicit method of solution is developed with conductivity as anarbitrary function of temperature . application is made to a sample caseof re-entry heating encountered by aerodynamic bodies, with erosion bysublimation and combustion occurring at the body surface .

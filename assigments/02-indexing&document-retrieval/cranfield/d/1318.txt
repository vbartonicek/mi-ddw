stagnation temperature measurements in a hypersonic gun tunnel using thesodium-line reversal method .the sodium line reversal /s.l.r./ method has recently been used tomeasure transient temperatures in the 1400degreek to 3000degreek range, forexample ref.6 reports measurements of gun flash temperatures . in thegun tunnel, stagnation temperatures in the above range can be generatedflow between a blunt body and its bow shock wave . the gas temperaturein this zone is close to the stagnation value .

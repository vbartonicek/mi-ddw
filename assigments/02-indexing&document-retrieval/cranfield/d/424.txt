cantilever plate with concentrated edge load .the author gives, by the method of finite differences, anapproximate solution of the problem of a finite lengthof a cantilever plate which bears a concentrated load atthe longitudinal free edge .  all the boundary conditionsare taken into account, and the plate action isdetermined approximately at all points of the plate .  theauthor points out that a secondary maximum transversestress occurs at the clamped edge nearest the loadingpoint, and that the longitudinal stress is greatest directlyunder the loading point .

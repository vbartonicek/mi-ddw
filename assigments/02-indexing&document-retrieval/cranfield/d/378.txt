engineering relations for friction and heat transfer to surfaces in highvelocity flow .in calculations of thermodynamic heating for high speed missilesparameters have been used based on relationships which hold forconstant-property fluids . the validity of this procedure has been verifiedrecently in a survey of heat transfer in which a relationship for thereference temperature was developed . a calculation procedure forlaminar and turbulent boundary layers, based on this relationship, isgiven .

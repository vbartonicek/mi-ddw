data on shape and location of detached shock wavesin cones and sphere .accurate experimental data are given on the shape and the locationof detached shock waves on cones and spheres at mach numbers from 1.17to 1.81 .  the data are correlated to obtain equations that describe theshock waves .  this knowledge of the shock waves should be useful incalculations of the pressure distribution and the pressure drag of thefore part of cones and spheres .  the experimental data on shock wavesare compared with theory .

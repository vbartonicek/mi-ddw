effects of boundary layer displacement and leading edge bluntness onpressure distribution, skin friction, and heat transfer of bodies athypersonic speeds .results are presented of an investigation to determine the effect ofboundary-layer displacement and leading-edge bluntness on surfaces inhypersonic flow . the presence of the boundary layer and the bluntleading edge induce pressure gradients which in turn affect the skinfriction and heat transfer to the surface . methods for predicting thesephenomena on two-dimensional surfaces are given and a brief review ofrecent three-dimensional results is presented .

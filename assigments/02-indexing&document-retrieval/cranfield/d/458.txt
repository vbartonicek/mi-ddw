a new series for calculation of steady laminar boundarylayer flows .a new and general method for solvingproblems of plane and steady laminarboundary layer flows in incompressiblefluids with arbitrary outer pressuredistribution is developed .  this methodis based on the introduction of thedimensionless quantitiesas new independent spatial variables .ordinates, u(x) the given outer velocitydistribution, v the kinematic viscosity .)the solution of the boundary layer problemis then given as a power series in ewith coefficient functions depending on n .this series is a formally exact solutionof the boundary layer problem .the new series solution has the following qualities ..have the significance only of cartesiancoordinates, the influence of wallcurvature being neglected in boundarylayer theory, the new coordinatesare adjusted to the data of the specialproblem in any case of application .the new variables represent a logicaldevelopment of former efforts inthe field of boundary-layer flow calculation .with other series solutions known forsome special cases is that the leadingterm of the new series satisfiesexactly the outer boundary conditionat all cross-sections along the wall .therefore, the succeeding terms givecorrections only in the inner part ofthe boundary layer .  accordingly,taking also no. 1 into account, the zeroorder term by itself gives a goodapproximation for the boundary layer flow .

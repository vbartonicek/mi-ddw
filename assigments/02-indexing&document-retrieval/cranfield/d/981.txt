solutions to the heat-conduction equation with time dependent boundaryconditions .design charts based on the analytical solution to the problem ofone-dimensional heat flow in a solid body of constant material propertieswith time-dependent boundary conditions were presented by kaye andyeh . this solution dealt with aerodynamic heating at hypersonic speedswhere the surface coefficient of heat transfer and the temperaturepotential were taken to be linear functions of time of flight . in orderto make these charts of more general application, general solutions arepresented which, together with the charts, enable rapid and reasonableestimates to be made of the transient temperature distributions in manypractical cases .

addendum to 'heat transfer to satellite vehicles re-entering theatmosphere .the original paper gave a correlation formula for stagnation point heattransfer rate to a blunt body of revolution in hypersonic flow . thisnote gives a somewhat refined version, based on further calculation andshock tube data . its effect on the conclusions of the original paper isnegligible except at surface temperature parameters of over 5000r-ft1/8 . in other problems, where heat transfer rate itself isimportant, it can make a significant defference .

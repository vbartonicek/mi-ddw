an improvement on donnell's approximation for thin-walledcircular cylinders .donnell's equation for thin-walled circular cylinders is replaced bywhere w is a non-dimensional form of the radial displacement and q isthe distributed radial loading .  this equation retains the essentialsimplicity of the original but, unlike donnell's equation, the accuracydoes not decrease as the wavelength of circumferential distortionincreases .

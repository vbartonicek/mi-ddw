a further note on the calculation of heat transferthrough the axisymmetrical laminar boundary layer ona circular cylinder .by using a karman-pohlhausen methodthe distribution of local rate of heattransfer is ovaluated for the case of air flowin an axisymmetrical laminar boundarylayer on a heated circular cylinder, the temperatureof the cylinder being independentof downstream distance .  this calculationserves to link the numerical valuesobtained by seban, bond, and kellyfor small downstream distances to thoseobtained by bourne and davies for largedownstream distances .

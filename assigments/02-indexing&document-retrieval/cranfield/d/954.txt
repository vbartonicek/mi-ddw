analysis of stress at several junctions in pressurizedshells .theoretical and experimental results arepresented for the discontinuity stresses arising at achange of wall thickness in a cylinder, acylinder-hemisphere junction, and a cone-spherical torusjunction in pressure vessels .  the effect of mismatchof nonconcurrence of the middle surfaces of twojoined cylinders is considered .  in addition, acylinder with a special closure which has considerablyreduced stresses is described, and curves withtheoretical and experimental stresses are presented .

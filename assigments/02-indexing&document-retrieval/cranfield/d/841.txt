on the bending of circular cylindrical shells underpure bending .the stability of circular cylindrical shells under pure bending isinvestigated by means of batdorf's modified donnell's equation and thegalerkin method .  the results of this investigation have shown that,contrary to the commonly accepted value, the maximum critical bendingstress is for all practical purposes equal to the critical compressivestress .

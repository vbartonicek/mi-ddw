preliminary results of density measurements from an air force satellite.atmospheric density was determined from a singly mounted ionizationgauge flown on an air force satellite . included is a brief descriptionof the experiment and theory as well as a discussion of some of theproblems involved in performing these measurements . density data aregiven for the altitude range of 370 to 400 km during early morning hoursfor the two days 17 and 18 june 1961 . results are compared with thoseof the 1961 revised u.s. standard atmosphere .

the contraction of satellite orbits under the influence of air dragpart i . with spherically symmetrical atmosphere .the effect of air drag on satellite orbits of small eccentricity e/0.2/is studied analytically by a perturbation method, on the assumption thatthe atmosphere is spherically symmetrical . equations are derived whichshow/1/how orbital period and perigee distance vary with eccentricityas the orbit contracts, and/2/how each of these quantities varies withtime . the equations of type/1/are nearly independent of the oblatenessof the atmosphere . in all the equations, terms of order e and higherare usually neglected . the results are also presented graphically, in amanner designed for practical use .the theory is to be extended to an oblate atmosphere in part ii, andwill later be compared with observation .

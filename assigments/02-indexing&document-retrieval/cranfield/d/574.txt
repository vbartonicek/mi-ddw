inviscid flow with nonequilibrium molecular dissociation for pressuredistributions encountered in hypersonic flight .one-dimensional inviscid nonequilibrium flows of a two-component modelgas are studied for prescribed pressure variations and an averagereaction rate based on recent data for oxygen recombination . these flowsare interpreted in relation to the flow along streamlines around blunthypersonic bodies . assuming equilibrium conditions in the subsonicregion, it is estimated that the flow in the initial supersonicexpansion region, which is approximately of prandtl-meyer character, will bechemically frozen with respect to the molecular dissociation of theprimary components under the hypersonic, high-altitude flight conditionsconsidered . the flight conditions consist of flight velocities betweenfurthermore, on bodies of small surface inclination beyond the nose, theflow will continue to be effectively frozen for at least 20 ftdown-stream of the nose . these conclusions may lead to the simplification ofprocedures for theoretical calculation and testing .the problem of distinguishing a dimensionless length-reaction rateparameter, which characterizes the extent of departures from equilibrium orfrom frozen behavior in the flow fields of interest here, is discussed

compression tests on circular cylinders stiffened longitudinallyby closely spaced z-section stringers .six circular cylinders stiffened longitudinally by closely spacedz-section stringers were loaded to failure in compression .  the resultsobtained are presented and compared with available theoretical resultsfor the buckling of orthotropic cylinders .  the results indicate thatthe large disparity that exists between theory and experiment forunstiffened compression cylinders may be significantly smaller forstiffened cylinders .

integrals and integral equations in linearized wing theory .the formulas of subsonic and supersonic wing theory for source, doublet,and vortex distributions are reviewed, and a systematic presentation isprovided which relates these distributions to the pressure and to thevertical induced velocity in the plane of the wing . it is shown thatcare must be used in treating the singularities involved in the analysisand that the order of integration is not always reversible . conceptssuggested by the irreversibility of order of integration are shown to beuseful in the inversion of singular integral equations when operationaltechniques are used . a number of examples are given to illustrate themethods presented, attention being directed to supersonic flightspeeds .
